<h1> Capstone Project Module 2: Customer Segmentation of Giant Foods Supermarket </h1>



## 1. Project Overview
# Background
Giant Food, A very old supermarket chain has been open a long time now but only has started its digital transformation. It has started modernizing its approaches but is still confused on how to exactly execute it's technology integration. For a few years it already has digitized some of the data it's collected. It also recently launched some campaigns but it has not made significant improvements. Using the data they were already collecting, they decided to study its customers to better understand them. 

## Business Problem: 
The supermarket has different ways to promote and sell their products. However, without targeted campaigns the promotions are ineffective. By getting to know our customer, we can more effectively engage them based on their behavior. From the raw data given, we can create customer segmentation to make better marketing decisions, properly manage stock and operations, and even increase revenue if done correctly. 


## Project Objective/Goal: 
We want to put our customers in groups or create customer segmentation. They will be divided on available data such as demographics, education, income, and even purchasing behavior. These segments can then be used to change decisions made by stakeholders such as the marketing team or operations team. 

## Guiding Questions: 
- Customer Understanding: Who are our customers and how can we improve their shopping experience? 

- Customer sensitivity to campaigns: Which customers are more responsive to campaigns and promotions?

- Customer behavior: Which customers are responsible for most of our revenue? (Pareto principle)

- Customer Behavior: Does spending behavior change between different shopping platforms? (Offline vs Online shopping)

## Stakeholders: 
The current dataset for the supermarket have actionable insights that primarily the marketing team can use. They will be able to understand customer behavior better, Plan and Execute campaigns, Manage discounts and promotions, and Building Loyalty programs from the Customer segmentation done. 

Other stakeholders can include Product team, Operations team, Customer support team.

## 5. Summary of Finding
### 5.1 Business Insight
From our analysis of the supermarket customer dataset, we identified key differences in campaign response behavior across demographic and behavioral factors. We also segmented customers using LRFM metrics to assess value and engagement levels.

Key findings include:
- The overall campaign response rate was relatively low, but varied significantly across customer segments.
- The highest response rates were found in:
  - **New High-Value Customers** (39%)
  - **Loyal Customers** (38%)
  - **Customers Who Need Attention** (32%)
- The lowest response rates were found in:
  - **Old Inactive Customers** (9%)
  - **New Low-Value Customers** (12%)
### 5.2 Actionable Recommendation
1. **Prioritize campaign targeting toward high-response segments**  
   Focus on **New High-Value**, **Loyal**, and **Need Attention** customer segments for campaign investment.

2. **Design differentiated campaigns for each segment**  
   - *Loyal Customers*: Offer loyalty rewards, exclusive early access, or personalized messages.  
   - *New High-Value Customers*: Use onboarding bundles and welcome promotions.  
   - *Customers Who Need Attention*: Run re-engagement campaigns such as limited-time discounts or reminders.

3. **Use demographic-informed messaging**  
   - Tailor messages based on generational preferences (e.g., convenience-focused for younger, health-focused for older).  
   - Highlight quality, exclusivity, or sustainability to appeal to highly educated and high-income customers.
